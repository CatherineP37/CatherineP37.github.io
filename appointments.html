		  <h1 id="introduction">Appointment Booking App</h1>
		  <p>This is a responsive app that helps to make it easy for patients to book appointments at a medical
centre. The website helps to reduce the number of calls coming through to the medical centre. This
means that the patients who do call in don't have to wait as long for their call to be answered.

The doctor adds their availablity in the admin area. The availability is added to the list of available
appointments in the booking form.</p>
