		  <h1>Appointment Booking App</h1>
		  <p>This is a responsive app that helps to make it easy for patients to book appointments at a medical
                  centre. The website helps to reduce the number of calls coming through to the medical centre. This
                  means that the patients who do call in don't have to wait as long for their call to be answered.

                  The doctor adds their availablity in the admin area. The availability is added to the list of available
                  appointments in the booking form.</p>		 
		<h2>User Research</h2>
		  <h3>User Research Goals</h3>
		  <ul> 
			  <li>Understand user goals when using this type of website</li>
                          <li>Understand user pain points when using websites</li>
                          <li>Understand what type of tasks users carry out on these types of websites</li>
		  </ul>
			  
		  <h3>Surveys and Interviews</h3>
		  <p>For the quantitative research, I carried out a survey to find out about what users expect from a medical
                  appointment booking website. For the qualitative research, I interviewed people who had experience with
                  booking medical appointments online.
