		  <h1>Banking App</h1>
		  <p>This is a banking app UX/UI design project that I worked on. The app can be used to do a variety of tasks such as checking a balance, 
        making a transfer and saving money. One of the challenges of designing a banking app is balancing convenience with security. </p>		 
		<h2>User Research</h2>
		  <h3>User Research Goals</h3>
		  <ul> 
			  <li>Understand user goals when using this type of website</li>

		  </ul>
			  
		  <h3>Surveys and Interviews</h3>
		  <p>For the quantitative research, I carried out a survey to find out about what users expect from a banking app. For the qualitative research,
        I interviewed people who had experience with a online banking.
