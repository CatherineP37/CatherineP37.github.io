		  <h1>Hotel Mobile Website</h1>
		  <p>This is a UX/UI design project for a hotel mobile website. The website allows users to book a stay at a hotel. Users can search 
        for a room based on specific criteria. They can see pictures of the room and learn about what the rooms have to offer. They can 
        then select a room and book a stay.</p>
